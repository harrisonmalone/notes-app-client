This site! I really wanted to make an app that did 3 things really well: 

1. A twitter replacement for me to share short form thoughts
2. A scratch pad
3. A blog for longer form posts

I also wanted the app to always open to a new note page (when authenticated) to replicate exactly what it's like when working on my Mac and I have some thoughts that I want to write down. This was usually handled via TextEdit.app and the notes were stored in iCloud.

A photo's app to store memories in.

The idea sprung about as I basically wanted to have a client app that interfaced with an S3 bucket which is where I archive all my images.

I also wanted to have a digital memory of one single day represented through a date, a photo and a description of what happened that day.

The app complements the way in which I handle photos using a script to rename the actual image files and then uploading them to S3 using Transmit.
